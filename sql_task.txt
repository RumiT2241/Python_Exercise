1. Average salary of employee
select avg(SALARY) from employee;

2. Update previous query to give us the average salary for each company.
select avg(SALARY) from employee group by COMPANY_GUID;

3. Letâ€™s assume your previous query was long running how would you go about debugging
I will use EXPLAIN for query plan and execution.
Also will add index over field used in group by


Write a SQL report that gives us average salary's of all positions
select avg(SALARY) from employee group by POSITION_GUID;

Update previous query to give us average salary's of all positions for each company
select company_guid,POSITION_GUID, avg(SALARY) from employee group by POSITION_GUID,COMPANY_GUID;
with names
select position_sql.NAME,company_sql.NAME, avg(SALARY)
    from employee_sql, position_sql,company_sql
    where employee_sql.POSITION_GUID = position_sql.GUID and
          employee_sql.COMPANY_GUID =company_sql.GUID
    group by employee_sql.POSITION_GUID,employee_sql.COMPANY_GUID;
